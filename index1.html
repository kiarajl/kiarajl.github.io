                Considering this was written in 1945, Bush's hopes and predictions of how technology would someday progress is very impressive, as it is not very far off from what we have today. I liked the idea of sorting information in a way that coincides with humans' natural thought patterns. As he mentioned, information was usually filed alphabetically or numerically. This is by no means a bad or wrong way to file things, in fact as I was reading I felt that Bush was pushing the idea that there is no wrong way of sorting information. However, alphabetical or numerical organization is not the best way for every person to store and recall what they have consumed. Being more flexible in this allows for the mass of information being published to the public to be used in a meaningful way and not "extended far beyond our present ability to amke real use of the record."
