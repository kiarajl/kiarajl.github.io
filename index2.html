                    This conversation reminded me of Yoko Ono's "Cut Piece". This was a performance piece where she sat alone on stage dressed in her best suit with a pair of scissors. The audience was told that they could go up to her and cut off a piece of her suit, which they would then keep. Some people cut tiny pieces off while others were bold and cut off the sleeves of her bra. The whole performance, Ono stayed motionless and expressionless. This reminds me of the European paintings wehre naked women are the subjects.
