        <h1>Documentation for Warm Arteries</h1>

        <h3>The first issue I ran into was not being able to align things properly on the page. The warm arteries title I had at first refused to be centered, but I overcame that by putting the parent element position in relative and the child elements in absolute.</h3>

        </div>

        <h3 id="popups">The next issue I quickly ran into was with my javascript popups. I wanted two different buttons to make two different popups show up, but both buttons made the same one appear. I'm currently still trying to fix this issue... its proving difficult to say the least.</h3>

        <h3 id="usertesting">My friends were able to test what I had for my website so far. At this point I just had my mis-aligned title and disfunctioning buttons. However, I did add some directory buttons with a cool little circle cursor.</h3>

        </div>

        <h3 id="currently">After the user testing, I took their feedback and continued on making the rest of the website. Things went pretty smoothly except for the popup buttons. I still am unable to figure out how to make them different :(. Also the directory buttons stopped working when you're in the collection page which is upsetting because they were working before but then they just suddenly stopped, so I also have to keep trying to fix that.</h3>

        <h3 id="kc">I also asked my sister to check out the website on her end. She looked at it on her phone... and its not great on mobile.. but that is an issue for a different time.</h3>
